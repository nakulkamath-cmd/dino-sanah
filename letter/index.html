      <p class="letter">
        hi cutu!<br><br>

        You lost the game : /, but no worries you can go again, after you read this letter.<br><br>

        Okay, even I havenâ€™t done thisâ€”digitally writing a letter-ish thing like ever, but letâ€™s see if Iâ€™ve got it in me at all.<br><br>

        You might notice that I am <em>"repurposing"</em> your letter but with my own words. Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s a good thing or a bad thing, but Iâ€™m hoping itâ€™s a good thing.<br><br>

        I could go on about the same equation of friendship or the story about how we met, but you've already talked about it and I do not intend to change anything about it. I just want to write a little about how much I love you and how much I appreciate you as a friend.<br><br>

        You genuinely are one of the most amazing people Iâ€™ve ever met. Youâ€™re so kind, caring, and always there for me when I need you. You make me laugh, you make me smile, and you make me feel like nice overall. Youâ€™re a true friend, and Iâ€™m so grateful to have you in my life.<br><br>

        I know that life can be tough sometimes, but I want you to know that Iâ€™m always here for you. Iâ€™ll always be your cheerleader, your support system, and your friend. You can always count on me to be there for you, no matter what.<br><br>

        I hope you have a wonderful birthday, filled with love, laughter, and all the things that make you happy (like for example <em>me</em>). You deserve it all and more. Iâ€™m so excited to see what this year has in store for you, and I canâ€™t wait to celebrate with you.<br><br>

        What a year it has been, right? I mean, I didn't even know you the way I do now. The sudden turn of events, divine intervention maybe, that took us from classmates who barely spoke to absolute cutus needs to be studied. But whatever it was, I am forever grateful for it.<br><br>

        I had an amazing time with you every time we met, especially when we went out, date or <em>otherwise</em>. I loved every moment of it, even more so when we could do what we want without being anxious about it.<br><br>

        Can't wait to spend another year with you, and more importantly, can't wait to see you grow into the person you want to be. I know you can do it, and Iâ€™ll be there every step of the way, be it leetcode or emotional support.<br><br>

        <strong>HAPPY 21ST BIRTHDAY!!!</strong><br><br>

        I hope you have a good day and a great year ahead! I wish you nothing but loads and loads of happiness and blessings from God and your family!! And I need you to know this: Iâ€™m always gonna be here cheering for you and Iâ€™ll be there at the end of the finish line. ðŸ’–<br><br>

        â€” With lots of love,
        <br><strong>nakul</strong>
